        I love building web applications. That's visual,
        not too hard to learn and fun. But building again and again things that have already been done don't interest me. What I love the most in IT is
        solving problems, and most of all, innovating.  That's why I'm learning everyday about AI, such as computer vision, NLP, and reinforcement learning.
        Obviously it is not the only domain innovating at the moment but it represents for me the perfect mix between software engineering and mathematics.
        I'm currently looking for new opportunities in web development and AI, so feel free to reach out if you have something interesting to propose!
